The inability of Seller to fill an Order within the delivery period requested by Buyer does not entitle Buyer to claim damages or release Buyer from its obligations under the Contract, including its obligation to place orders and take subsequent deliveries in the case of Volume Contracts.

                2.4    The “Delivery Location” for Product is Seller’s facility (“Seller’s Facility”), unless otherwise specified in the Confirmation.   (b) Seller shall not be held responsible for delivery errors or damages attributable to freight carrier or others,  including claims of contamination or for penalties, late charges or fees (collectively, “Delivery Claims”).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller will submit Buyer’s Delivery Claims to the freight carrier and make reasonable attempts to seek reimbursement of the Delivery Claims. 2.5

                3.    TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS.

                Title and risk of loss to Product shall transfer to Buyer at the Delivery Location when possession of Product is taken by Buyer  (for pickup at our facility buyer takes possession upon pickup; for delivered product buyer takes possession upon delivery.)

                4.    PRICES AND INVOICES.

                4.1    Unless otherwise stated in the Confirmation, Prices for Product are per case (the “Price”).  .  Price is exclusive of any sales, processing, excise, value added or other taxes, and when required by law, such taxes shall be added to the purchase price of the Product on the related invoice and paid by Buyer.

                4.2    Seller shall invoice Buyer promptly after Tender of Delivery. Unless otherwise indicated on the invoice, Buyer shall pay Seller for Product purchased within 11 days of the invoice date in United States dollars to pay the full amount or in 10 days in order to receive a 2% discount, by electronic payment to the Seller's designated bank account or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Seller. In the event Buyer prefers to pay by check, such payment shall be sent to Seller's address set forth in the invoice.

                4.3    Claims regarding discounts or prices not made within 12 months from the date of invoice shall be deemed waived and released by Buyer.

                4.4    Buyer is not entitled to set-off amounts due or claimed due from Seller against any amounts Buyer owes to Seller.

                4.5    Buyer agrees that any statement on a payment transmission or indicating that it is “payment in full” or other statements to that effect is a nullity unless acknowledged and accepted by Seller in writing and that cashing such check does not constitute acceptance.   4.6    Any amounts which are not paid when due shall bear interest from the date payment was due until the date payment is received by Seller, at a rate of interest equal to the lower of (i) 1.5% per month or (ii) the highest rate of interest permitted under applicable law.

                5.    BUYER’S CREDIT.

                Any credit granted to Buyer may in the sole discretion of Seller be reduced or withdrawn at any time, any previously approved payment terms to the contrary notwithstanding. Seller reserves the right to withhold, suspend or stop in transit any shipment should any doubt arise as to Buyer’s credit or financial responsibility.

                6.    SELLER’S WARRANTY

                6.3    In the event Buyer rejects Product as non-conforming to this warranty, Buyer shall timely inform Seller in writing of the specific factual basis for the rejection and shall hold such Product until Seller removes the Product or provides Buyer with other reasonable instructions.  Seller’s liability under this warranty is limited to either replacing the non-conforming Product or refunding to Buyer its purchase price paid for such Product.  Buyer is prohibited from selling rejected Product in a secondary market without Seller’s written consent.

                6.4    All claims by Buyer relating to the Product must be brought within one year of delivery of the Product to Buyer Regardless of their nature.

                6.5    Any continuing guaranty provided by Seller to Buyer remains subject to, and governed by, the terms of the Contract.

                7.    INDEMNIFICATION.

                7.2    Any indemnification provided hereunder is on the condition that written notice of any action, claim or proceeding within the scope of this indemnity shall be provided promptly to SELLER. Further, SELLER’s obligation to defend is conditioned upon SELLER selecting, managing and controlling counsel.

                8. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.

                THE LIABILITY OF SELLER FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRODUCT AND THE USE THEREOF SHALL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED THE SUM OF BUYER’S PAYMENTS FOR THE PRODUCT THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE CLAIM.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL SELLER OR ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE TO BUYER OR ANY OTHER PERSON, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF CLAIM, FOR ANY KIND OF SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGE OR LOSS, COST OR EXPENSE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES BASED UPON LOST GOODWILL, LOST SALES OR PROFITS, WORK STOPPAGE, DOWNTIME, PRODUCTION FAILURE, IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER PRODUCTS OR INGREDIENTS, ATTORNEY’S OR CONSULTANT’S FEES, FOR ANY REASON OR UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF SELLER HAS BEEN ADVISED OR SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

                Seller agrees to maintain commercial general liability insurance including Product liability and contractual liability, on a claims made basis with minimum limits of liability of $2,000,000.

                10.    TERMINATION AND CERTAIN REMEDIES.

                If either party breaches any of the material provisions of the Contract, the other party shall have the right to terminate the Contract upon 30 days' written notice (10 days in the case of a payment default) whereupon the Contract shall terminate unless the breach complained of is corrected within such notice period.  Nothing herein shall be deemed as limiting the rights and remedies of Seller. If either party shall (a) become bankrupt or insolvent, (b) file for a petition therefor, (c) make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (d) have a receiver appointed for its assets, which appointment shall not be vacated within 60 days after the filing, then the other party shall be entitled to terminate the Contract immediately upon written notice to such party.

                11.    FORCE MAJEURE.

                A party shall not be liable for the inability of that party to commence or complete its obligations (excluding the obligation of payment) hereunder by the dates herein required resulting from delays caused by strikes, insurrection, acts of God, war, emergencies, shortages or unavailability of materials, weather, change in law or other similar causes (“Force Majeure”), which shall have been timely communicated to the other party.  The occurrence of the Force Majeure shall extend the period for the performance of the obligation (excluding the obligation of payment), for the period equal to the period of any such delays; provided that such party shall continue to perform to the extent feasible in view of such Force Majeure; and provided further, that if such Force Majeure shall continue for a period of six months, either party shall have the right to terminate this Contract upon written notice to the other.  In the event of the occurrence of a Force Majeure event, Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to allocate Product among its buyers.

                12.    COPACKERS.

                Buyer may fulfill its purchase obligations under the Contract through one or more of its authorized copackers; provided that Buyer designates such copackers in writing to Seller.  Seller shall accept purchase orders from designated copackers as purchase orders delivered under the Contract and Seller shall, as a matter of convenience to Buyer, invoice such copackers directly for payment of Products delivered to them; however, in the event of any non-payment by copacker, Buyer remains responsible for payment to Seller.  The purchase and sale of Products to Buyer’s copackers shall be subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Contract and Buyer represents and warrants that it has authority to bind its copackers to the terms and conditions of the Contract.

                14.    ASSIGNMENT.

                Except to the extent provided herein, Buyer shall not have any right to assign the Contract, or any rights or obligations hereunder, without the written consent of Seller; provided, however, that upon the sale of all or substantially all of the assets, business and goodwill of the Buyer to another company, or upon the merger or consolidation of the Buyer with another company, the Contract shall be binding upon both Buyer and the company purchasing such assets, business and goodwill, or surviving such merger or consolidation, as the case may be, in the same manner and to the same extent as though such other company were the Buyer.  Further, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer consents to the assignment from time to time of any part of Seller’s rights to payment hereunder in respect of invoices addressed to Buyer or its Affiliates (a “Receivable”), and in connection with such assignments, and notwithstanding any confidentiality agreements to the contrary, Seller may disclose the terms of the contractual arrangements between Buyer and Seller solely for the purpose of assigning any Receivables and in order for assignee to collect such payments to which it may become entitled.  Subject to the foregoing, the Contract shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the parties hereto and their legal representatives, successors, and permitted assigns.

Additionally, Buyer understands and acknowledges that the United States maintains lists of persons and entities prohibited from participating in any U.S. export or re-export transaction (http://www.export.gov/ecr/eg_main_023148.asp.).  Whenever Seller believes that a violation of the U.S. export control laws may occur or has occurred, Seller reserves the right to request additional information regarding the end-user and/or destination of the Products and Buyer agrees to provide such information.  Seller reserves the right to refuse to proceed with any transaction where Seller determines that the transaction may violate the U.S. export controls laws and to terminate and discontinue doing business with any Buyer that Seller determines has engaged in transactions placing Seller at risk of violation of such laws.

                15.2    Buyer represents and warrants that it shall use and sell all Products ordered herein in accordance with applicable law, statute, ordinance, regulation, code or standard (“Laws and Standards”).

Buyer represents that it owns, or has the right to use, the trademarks (“Trademarks) which will appear on the Packaging Materials.  Buyer warrants that the Trademarks will not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third parties, and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its respective Affiliates, successors and assigns, harmless from and against any and all actions, claims, liability, cost, damage or expense, including attorneys’ fees and other expenses of defense, arising from or relating to the Trademarks or Buyer’s warranty contained in this Section 16.

                17.  CONFIDENTIALITY.

                All disclosures, including specifications, pricing, financial data, formulae, samples, research, product plans, products, services, suppliers, inventions, processes, or other proprietary information furnished by Seller or any of its Affiliates to Buyer (“Confidential Information”), are the sole property of Seller or its Affiliates and are submitted in confidence upon the understanding and agreement by Buyer that Confidential Information shall not be disclosed or furnished to any third party nor used by Buyer in whole or in part for any purpose except as agreed in writing by Seller.

Any such waiver, extension or amendment shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing executed by an officer authorized to execute waivers, extensions or amendments. Seller’s failure to strictly enforce any term or condition of this Contract or to exercise any right arising hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of Seller’s right to strictly enforce such terms or conditions or exercise such right thereafter.

                22.    FINAL AGREEMENT.

                This Contract represents the final agreement of the parties with respect to its subject matter and all prior oral or written undertakings, communications, or agreements are superseded and merged herein.  No different or additional terms and conditions, including those contained in any Order or agreement previously executed by Seller or in any acceptance or similar document tendered by Buyer, shall in any way become binding on Seller or become part of the Contract and are hereby specifically rejected.
